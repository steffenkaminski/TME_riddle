TME_riddle


To reveal my ciphers you must translate <br/>
Over a hill you will find your fate<br/>
Squeeze a 9 in an array<br/>
This will help you on your way<br/>
In these bad rhymes are numbers hid<br/>
Put them together to fill your grid<br/>

A starry brew to be drunk til dawn<br/>
But how many centuries 'til I was born

At midday my hands embrace<br/>
How many numbers on my face

Count my options for a piss<br/>
Only misters not for miss

Number tables on this floor<br/>
Add Snow White's friends to get the score

Plenty treads are on this flight<br/>
Subtract my fingers to get it right

Flickering lights that lead the way<br/>
If one is spent how few remain?

Double me and I will bring<br/>
Life, the universe and everything

Take twin digits for my name<br/>
Sum or product will be the same

My Jupilers come in a crate<br/>
You get half cause you're my mate

Your task is almost at an end<br/>
To one more rhyme you must attend<br/>
My first is an idiot, twit or heel<br/>
My second is the centre of a wheel
