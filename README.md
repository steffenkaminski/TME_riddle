TME_riddle


To reveal my ciphers you must translate
Over a hill you will find your fate
Squeeze a 9 in an array
This will help you on your way
In these bad rhymes are numbers hid
Put them together to fill your grid

A starry brew to be drunk til dawn
But how many centuries 'til I was born

At midday my hands embrace
How many numbers on my face

Count my options for a piss
Only misters not for miss

Number tables on this floor
Add Snow White's friends to get the score

Plenty treads are on this flight
Subtract my fingers to get it right

Flickering lights that lead the way
If one is spent how few remain?

Double me and I will bring
Life, the universe and everything

Take twin digits for my name
Sum or product will be the same

My Jupilers come in a crate
You get half cause you're my mate

Your task is almost at an end
To one more rhyme you must attend
My first is an idiot, twit or heel
My second is the centre of a wheel
